/*
 Consider the following program segment:
      //include statement(s)
      //using namespace statement
 int main()
 {
 }
 a. Write C11 statements that include the header files iostream and string.
 b. Write a C11 statement that allows you to use cin, cout, and endl without the prefix std::.
 c. Write C11 statements that declare and initialize the following named constants: SECRET of type int initialized to 11 and RATE of type double initialized to 12.50.
 d. Write C11 statements that declare the following variables:
 num1, num2, and newNum of type int; name of type string; and hoursWorked and wages of type double.
 e. Write C11 statements that prompt the user to input two integers and store the first number in num1 and the second number in num2.
 f. Write a C11 statement(s) that outputs the values of num1 and num2, indicating which is num1 and which is num2. For example, if num1 is 8 and num2 is 5, then the output is:
         The value of num1 = 8 and the value of num2 = 5.
 g. Write a C11 statement that multiplies the value of num1 by 2, adds the value of num2 to it, and then stores the result in newNum. Then, write a C11 statement that outputs the value of newNum.
 h. Write a C11 statement that updates the value of newNum by adding the value of the named constant SECRET to it. Then, write a C11 state- ment that outputs the value of newNum with an appropriate message.
 i. Write C11 statements that prompt the user to enter a person’s last name and then store the last name into the variable name.
 //variable declaration
 //executable statements
 //return statement

 Write C11 statements that prompt the user to enter a decimal number between 0 and 70 and then store the number entered into hoursWorked.
 Write a C11 statement that multiplies the value of the named con- stant RATE with the value of hoursWorked and then stores the result into the variable wages.
 Write C11 statements that produce the following output:
 m.
 45.50, then the output is:
 Name: Rainbow
 Pay Rate: $12.50
 Hours Worked: 45.50
 Salary: $568.75
 Write a C11 program that tests each of the C11 statements that you wrote in parts a through l. Place the statements at the appropri- ate place in the C11 program segment given at the beginning of this problem. Test run your program (twice) on the following input data:
 a. num1 = 13, num2 = 28; name = "Jacobson"; hoursWorked = 48.30.
 b. num1 = 32, num2 = 15; name = "Crawford"; hoursWorked = 58.45.
